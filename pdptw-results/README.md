# PDPTW Results
We'll have 2 types of results that will answer 2 questions:
* The [irace](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/irace/vignettes/irace-package.pdf) really shows the 4 experiment results in this order?
  1. Best parameters
  2. 2nd best parameters
  3. 3rd best parameters
  4. 4th best parameters
  
If the quality of the [Math PDPTW algorithm](https://github.com/cssartori/math-pdptw) gets worse in the Experiment with the **8-clusters** clustering, the hypothesis will be correct.
  
* A clustering with 16 clusters will reveal better results than a clustering with 8 clusters?
  
If the instances were more accurate and similar, the parameters given by irace should give to us even more better results.
 
In adition to this we will answer the following "bonus" question:
 
* Which type of instances the parameters with AGES New will bring better results and in which type the parameters with AGES Original will be better?
